# Notes

## 02.15-methods

The _methods_ are added to the `methods` _object_ on the Vue app.

All the properties and the methods are available under `this`.

Remember in JS `this` means "the context in which the code is called". It is not a reference to the object itself like in OOP languages,

The methods of Vue components can be asynchronous.
